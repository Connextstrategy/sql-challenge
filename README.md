# Python Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge - SQL Challenge

This activity is an introduction into SQL table creation, query, and analyses

## Description

In this assignment, it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

# Instructions

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling

1. Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site.

## Data Engineering

1. Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

* Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

* Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

2. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
* List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

* List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

* List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

* List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

* List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

* List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

### Dependencies


## SQL code writing and administration

* Using PostgresSQL database system for running of server for SQL creation and pgAdmin for admin, table creation and queries
* Using Quick Base Diagram



## Import CSV files to create tables in Resources folder
* departments.csv
* dept_emp.csv
* titles.csv
* salaries;
DROP TABLE dept_manager;
DROP TABLE employee

### Installing

* No modifications needed to be made to files/folders

## Help

The city data that you generate is based on random coordinates and different query times, so your outputs will not be an exact match to the provided starter notebook.

If you'd like a refresher on the geographic coordinate system, this siteLinks to an external site. has great information.

Take some time to study the OpenWeatherMap API. Based on your initial study, you should be able to answer basic questions about the API: Where do you request the API key? Which Weather API in particular will you need? What URL endpoints does it expect? What JSON structure does it respond with? Before you write a line of code, you should have a crystal-clear understanding of your intended outcome.

A starter code for citipy has been provided. However, if you're craving an extra challenge, push yourself to learn how it works by using the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site.. Before you try to incorporate the library in your analysis, start with simple test cases outside of your main script to confirm that you are using it correctly. Often, when introduced to a new library, learners spend hours trying to figure out errors in their code when a simple test case can save you a lot of time and frustration.

You will need to apply your critical thinking skills to understand how and why we're recommending these tools. What is citipy used for? Why would you use it in conjunction with the OpenWeatherMap API? How would you do so?

While building your script, pay attention to the cities you are using in your query pool. Are you covering the full range of latitudes and longitudes? Or are you choosing 500 cities from one region of the world? Even if you were a geography genius, simply listing 500 cities based on your personal selection would create a biased dataset. Try to think of ways that you can counter these selection issues.

      Hint: Consider the full range of latitudes.

Once you have computed the linear regression for one relationship, you will follow a similar process for all other charts. Optionally, try to create a function that will create these charts based on different parameters. (Note: there will be no extra points for completing this.)

Remember that each coordinate will trigger a separate call to the Google API. If you're creating your own criteria to plan your vacation, try to reduce the results in your DataFrame to 10 or fewer cities.
